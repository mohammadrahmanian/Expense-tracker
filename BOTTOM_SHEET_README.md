# Responsive Bottom Sheet Implementation

## Overview
All modals in the application now automatically display as bottom sheets on mobile devices while maintaining the traditional centered modal experience on desktop.

## What was implemented

### 1. Responsive Dialog Component (`src/components/ui/responsive-dialog.tsx`)
- **Desktop**: Centered modal with zoom animations
- **Mobile**: Bottom sheet with slide-up animations
- **Features**:
  - Drag indicator on mobile
  - Safe area inset support for devices with notches
  - Maximum height of 85vh on mobile with scrolling
  - Smooth animations with custom CSS keyframes

### 2. Updated Components
- ✅ **QuickExpenseModal** (FAB modal)
- ✅ **TransactionForm** (in Transactions page)
- ✅ **CategoryForm** (in Categories page)

### 3. Custom Animations
Added to `src/index.css`:
- `slide-in-from-bottom` - Smooth slide up animation
- `slide-out-to-bottom` - Smooth slide down animation
- Mobile safe area support

## Usage

Replace regular Dialog imports with responsive versions:

```tsx
// Before
import { Dialog, DialogContent, DialogHeader, DialogTitle } from "@/components/ui/dialog";

// After
import { 
  ResponsiveDialog as Dialog, 
  ResponsiveDialogContent as DialogContent,
  ResponsiveDialogHeader as DialogHeader,
  ResponsiveDialogTitle as DialogTitle 
} from "@/components/ui/responsive-dialog";
```

## Mobile Experience Features

- 🔒 **Safe Areas**: Respects device notches and home indicators  
- 📜 **Scrollable**: Handles long content gracefully
- ⚡ **Smooth Animations**: Custom CSS animations for better UX
